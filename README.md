# Hi TS!

An initializer with Webpack where typescript is provisioned with core components such as scss and assets structure.

You can use it to create a new project using typescript and webpack. A launcher with which you can quickly get started while building your own library.

During the development process of this launcher, care will be taken to keep it easy to understand.

```
